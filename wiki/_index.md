## Getting Started

Welcome to our Guided Tour Organisation, designed to familiarize new users with [JoyDX](https://joydx.com).

Follow the links below and within the next few minutes you'll have:

* Interacted with the auto-managed documentation...you're doing it now!
* As a Developer, [Launched and made changes to a live environment](/launch-environments)
* As an Analyst, [run a quality check on application changes](/analyze-app-changes)
* As an Admin, [configured your system](/the-system-environment) with a series of great development tools
* As a Team-member, [started customising your own easy-to-manage organisation](/managing-an-organisation) making collaboration simple

## More Than Just a Guide

This guide is more than just a set of instructions, it's a living example of how organisations work. Rather than being written separately, this site is an artefact generated from a JoyDX organisation. In the side navigation, you should notice "Technical Information" with the following:

* **Environments** provides a detailed breakdown of operating instructions for any application stacks defined within the organisation
* **Roles** provides a brief description of the tools used in performing various duties.
* **Tools** provides a full listing of external tools (along with description, links to docs, etc.)

The more you use JoyDX, the more relevant and up-to-date content can automatically created. It only took writing a few pages in markdown to completely create this documentation site as you see it now. Further customisation of the wiki (beyond this guide) is a short task:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used as the site framework with the site code located in your shared folder for full control. As JoyDX develops, more themes and customisation options will be made conveniently available
* Content pages are simple markdown files. Later on, look at the wiki section of your organisation to see how easy it is to make your own pages
* The HTML is purposefully simple with presentation based on Tailwind, and CSS variables heavily used. There is a theme selector along the top of the page to demonstrate some simple themes
