The environment manager allows you to spin up complex environments in seconds. It takes a simple spec, creates a detailed action plan, and executes it efficiently, including dependencies, no preparation required.

For a detailed breakdown of environments, see [the online page](https://joydx.com/docs/key-concepts/environments) for more information. This guide will demonstrate the core features for managing environments using a [typical React app](https://github.com/joy-dx/tudu-ts-react-frontend) and a [Go based backend](https://github.com/joy-dx/tudu-go-gin-backend) to create an online managed Todo list.
